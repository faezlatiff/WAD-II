              For those new to the ACG community, Golden Mix is an Anime Music party
              event, where people gather to rave to their favorite Anisongs and remixes,
              or simply to chill with friends while enjoying good music. Incase you were
              wondering, yes we are that Donki song party event!
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be two areas to the venue. The main central area is where you
              can dance, rave and enjoy the music best. The surrounding area will be for
              you guys to chill, away from the speakers, creating a bar-like mood to
              enjoy the music and still hold a conversation. Come on down and soak in
              the good vibes!
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no such thing as being ostracized for not knowing the calls or
              claps to the songs, just enjoy the music!
            </p>
